# Async adapter only works within the same process, so for manually triggering cable updates from a console,
# and seeing results in the browser, you must do so from the web console (running inside the dev process),
# not a terminal started via bin/rails console! Add "console" to any action or any ERB template view
# to make the web console appear.
development:
  adapter: async

test:
  adapter: test

production:
  # Use async adapter by default (no database required)
  # Set ENABLE_SOLID_CABLE=true to use solid_cable adapter
  adapter: <%= ENV['ENABLE_SOLID_CABLE'] == 'true' ? 'solid_cable' : 'async' %>
  <% if ENV['ENABLE_SOLID_CABLE'] == 'true' %>
